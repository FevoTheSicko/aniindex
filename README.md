Group project 1
To create a web application that uses 2 API’s
Contents of Project
This project contains an index.html file, script.js file, style.css file and a image folder consisting of any images/png’s used in our project.
Goals for Project
We wanted to build a web application that would successfully fetch Anime information from what a user has search on our app via API and return information matching our request. 
The Acceptance Criteria
The Acceptance Criteria are as follows;
* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two server-side APIs.

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
Satisfying the Acceptance Criteria
To satisfy the criteria requested, our application must use at least 2 server side API’s and produce a product from those API’s. We must also include client side storage to store any persistent data.
Our application must have an intuitive and easy to navigate design.

No JS alerts, prompts or confirms are to be used along with bootstrap. We must use another CSS framework. Application must also be interactive and work on multiple devices, accepts and responds to user input. No major disparities can occur with the group members on github.

Our presentation will also have to consist of a PowerPoint presentation where every member of the group must talk a bit about the project. 

Issues
We found that a few of the API’s we were originally using were expired which made it difficult to find one that would work with our project. We eventually found really good API’s called Jikan and Animechan that would help fetch the data we needed from the searched keyword. Github also was a major issue for our team. User error and getting familiar with the github commands led to plenty of git errors and branches with conflicts which did take up a lot of the teams time. 
Future Developments
We can, in the future, add in another API that will allow the user to not only see information and a quote from the searched anime, but also watch the episode on our site. This will allow the user to read and watch their favourite anime on one website. 
We could also create our site to be a social hub for anyone who loves Anime to post thoughts, reviews and questions on the anime that they watched and interacted with.
Besides the changes mentioned above, an update on the css style could also increase UI experience.
